Microsoft Azure Batch is a fully-managed cloud service that provides job scheduling and compute resources management for developers in organizations, independent software vendors, and cloud service providers. Both new and existing high performance computing (HPC) applications running on workstations and clusters today can be readily enabled to run in Azure at scale, and with no on-premises infrastructure required. Common application workloads include image and video rendering, media transcoding, engineering simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, and software test execution, among others; all highly parallel, computationally intensive workloads that can be broken into individuals tasks for execution. With azure Batch, you can scale from a a few VMs up to tens of thousands of VMs, and run the largest, most resource0intessive workloads.
